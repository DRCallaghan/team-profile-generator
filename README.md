  ## Description:
  - I built this project to provide a quick, easy, dynamic way for team managers or members to create information cards about their team members quickly.
  - This project helps in making extremely quick information available in an easy-to-digest and nice-looking format.
  - I learned quite a bit about how to properly nest inquirer prompts within themselves, as well as the advantages of calling class functions for iteration.
